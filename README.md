Hello!

This is my to do lists project.

This fullstack django project is about to do lists.

There will be a part where I explain in detail what this is about and a part of bulletpoiints of what I need to achieve with this project, a sort of documentation of my workflow.

Bulletpoints:
1. What are the models, forms, and views you need? - check todolist.drawio
2. What connections will there be? - check todolist.drawio
3. Need a place where to draw and put in all these relations, before actually coding. - Solved .drawio
4. Dependencies(Django, pillow, python). - Solved pillow on ubuntu.
5. Bootsrap5 can not be pip installed so just extend from base.html the CDN.
6. Figure out exact placements of lists in ListView.
7. Maybe different styles of bulletpoints(customisible/choose from a preset) on DetailedView of todolists.

Coding steps:
1. Todo project settings file setup - Static, templates, installed apps.
2. todo_app models create and register.
3. admin register new user model, or just extend it in models?
4. View for sign up(url, html) - thank you page.
5. View for login, logout.
